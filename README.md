# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-E-commerce-Data
this is a simple, easy guide to understand what EDA means and how to do it
EDA Exploratory Data Analysis is an essential process in doing Machine Learning, Data Science etc
It helps to derive insight from data and without difficulty you can make sense of what the data is  saying
By asking few questions from the data you can make a really Asaro-like Model i mean a very good model
As the popular saying Your model is as good as your data, so in EDA to me there are 5 important stage maybe more but this is what i know so 
if there is more please let me know as i hope to also learn from you
1. Context -- What the data is all about. is it about transaction, or about a context like an animal etc
2. Data Cleaning -- this takes about 70% of your time where you look for missing columns or values, where you rename and change dattype and many others
3. THE EDA -- this is where you ask the Question like how many people came to the party, at what month does the company make it hihest profit etc
4. Results -- Interpretation is what you do here you make sense of the question you ask based on the result you get
and Finally 5. Conclusion. 
Thanks to Admond Lee for the Good Work He had done. Happy Learning


Result could be made available to uses via presenting the analysis in a web app.
